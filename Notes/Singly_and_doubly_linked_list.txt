What is a Linked List ?
A linked list is a sequentail list of nodes that holds data which point
to another nodes also containing data.

Where are linked list used ?
- Used in list, Queue & Stack implementation.
- Great for creating circular list.
- Can easily model real world objects such as train.
- Used in separate chaining, which is present certain hastable
implementations to deal with hasing collisions.
- often used in the implementation of adjancy list for graphs.

Head: 
Tail:


Singly Linked: only hold reference to next node.

Doubly Linked: hold reference to both next node and the previous node.

            Pros            Cons 

Singly      Less memory    Cannot acess previous member

Doubly   Can be traversed   Takes 2x memory 
            backward
