TREE TRAVERSAL (preorder, Inorder, Postorder and level order)

- preorder prints before the recursive call.
- inorder prints between the recursive call.
- postorder prints after the recursive call.

PREORDER TRAVERSAL : print the value of the current node then traverse the left
subtree followed by the right subtree.

INORDER TRAVERSAL : 

POSTORDER TRAVERSAL: Traverse the left subtree followed by the right subtree the print the value of the node.

LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL: In a level order traversal we want to print the nodes as they appear one layer at a time.
To obtain the ordering we want to do a BREADTH FIRST SEARCH (BFS) from the root node down to the leaf node.

To do a BREADTH FIRST SEARCH we will need to manipulate a queue of the nodes left to explore.
Begin with the root inside of the queue and finish the queue is empty.
