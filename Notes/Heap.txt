WHAT IS A HEAP ?
a heap is a tree based data structure that satisfies the heap invariant.
If A is a parent node of B the A is ordered with respect to B for all nodes.

Heap is a complete binray tree data structure that satisfy heap property.
That the value of each of its children node is either greater than or equal 
to its own. Heaps are useful in priority queues, where the smallest or largest 
element is always at the root of the tree.

There are many types of heaps we could use to implement a priority queue:
- Binary heap
- Fibonacci heap 
- Binomial Heap 
- Pairing Heap
